# Positive Future

There are representations aplenty of dystopian futures. However, many research and foresight works focus on positive alternatives for the tomorrow's world.

On this positive basis, the [Paris Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.positive-future.org/about/organizers) and the [2100 Fondation](https://www.positive-future.org/about/organizers), in partnership with the [Institute for Futures Studies](https://www.positive-future.org/about/organizers), launched the Positive Future contest in order to encourage the elaboration and dissemination of inspiring narratives that convincingly and realistically describe a liveable and desirable world to come.
