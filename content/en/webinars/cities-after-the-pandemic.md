In addition to the scientific resources available in the "Food for thought" section, the Positive Future team offers scientific events, webinars, and online conferences to help participants in the contest, and for anyone interested in the themes tackled by the Positive Future project.

As part of the effort to recover from the crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, cities can reduce the impact of future pandemics and become more equitable, healthy and environmentally friendly," says a new UN-Habitat report released in late March 2021

The pandemic has indeed revealed what we know without having remembered: viruses like cities because of their narrow and dense configuration. Confinement in the city has made it possible to assess the need **for organizing public space in a "healthy" or even sanitary way.** This need may imply essential arrangements to **protect city dwellers from global warming** by establishing cooling zones, and developing mobility solutions other than the automobile. Local supply is also becoming a concern. It seems that in Europe, a growing number of citizens aspire to live in "medium-sized" cities, or in houses with gardens but close enough to large cities (potentially leading to mobility problems?) Finally, the pandemic and the confinements have highlighted urban precariousness. What is the perspective for ending this crisis?
