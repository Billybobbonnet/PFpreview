Because we believe that it is important for contest participants to draw on the current state of scientific knowledge to propose their story of a desirable and realistic city in 2100, the Positive Future team and its scientific committee provide a thematic resource base.

Notions of foresight and futures studies, an inventory of current challenges, creative ideas... Regularly enriched, these "[Food for thought](mailto:http://www.positive-future.org/resources)" topics enable you to give a credible background to the story you will propose.

Don't hesitate to consult our "[tips](mailto:http://www.positive-future.org/contest/tips)" to make sure you have all the chances on your side!

We look forward to diving into YOUR story of the future!
