In addition to the scientific resources available in the "Food for thought" section, the Positive Future team offers scientific events, webinars, and online conferences to help participants in the contest.It's a challenge to say what the city of tomorrow will be like, given the challenges, ruptures and progress of this century, which will lead to radical changes. To say how we dream it in a probable future, how to dream of achievable utopias, is a poetic exercise that takes us into an achievable ideals.

The Fédération nationale des agences d'urbanisme (Fnau) has placed its 2020 meetings under the sign of foresight. **The agencies worked in a network on the changes to 2040 to imagine a "world after" that would have succeeded in meeting the challenges of transitions.** The idea was to question the future through the notions of happiness and well-being, sustainable development and successful ecological transition, and democratic renewal, in order to build perspectives of desirable, but also credible, futures. **The proposed prospective visions have several facets: some are based on resilience in the face of the Covid-19 crisis, others are based on territorial imaginations or playful approaches to question territorial projects or the emergence of new public policies, by 2040.**

**This webinar, which will review the objective and method of the work carried out by the urban planning agencies, will present the converging trends drawn by the 12 working groups.**
