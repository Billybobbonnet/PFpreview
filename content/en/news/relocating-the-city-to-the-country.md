It's a challenge to say what the city of tomorrow will be like, given the challenges, ruptures and progress of this century, which will lead to radical changes. To say how we dream it in a probable future, how to dream of achievable utopias, is a poetic exercise that transports us into an ideal within reach.

"We should build cities in the countryside because the air is purer there" joked Alphonse Allais, a 19th century journalist, writer and humorist. This countryside, a flat landscape where the first fields were established, humanity invented agriculture. This countryside which allowed the creation of the city... The city was indeed built in the countryside. A serious joke after all. But how could the city forget the countryside that gave birth to it? This domesticated nature without which it was nothing.

The future inevitably turns to this nature, this countryside, which worries us so much today. **We will try to understand the trends and tracks that could reinstall the city in the countryside.**
