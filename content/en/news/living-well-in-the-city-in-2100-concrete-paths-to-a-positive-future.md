In addition to the scientific resources available in the "Food for thought" section, the Positive Future team offers scientific events, webinars, and online conferences over the course of the months to help participants in the contest.It's a challenge to say what the city of tomorrow will be like, given the challenges, ruptures and progress of this century, which will lead to radical changes. To say how we dream it in a probable future, how to dream of achievable utopias, is a poetic exercise that transports us into an ideal within reach.

**Living well in the city in 2100 is possible!** Faced with the climatic, demographic, economic and social challenges that are looming, technological progress, "good" public policies and, above all, the creativity of the greatest number of people offer solutions.

On the basis of existing experience and knowledge, the human and social sciences and prospective, can help to clear the way and propose perspectives in terms of social ties, urban planning and architecture, and governance.

**Jean-Éric Aubert**, President of the 2100 Foundation, and **Saadi Lahlou**, Director of the Institut d'Études Avancées de Paris, will present these approaches and show how it is possible today to design and prepare a positive future.

**_This webinar will be an opportunity for a question and answer session about the Positive Future contest, for all interested candidates._**
