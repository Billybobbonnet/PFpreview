In addition to the scientific resources available in the "Food for thought" section, the Positive Future team offers scientific events, webinars, and online conferences to help participants in the contest.It's a challenge to say what the city of tomorrow will be like, given the challenges, ruptures and progress of this century, which will lead to radical changes. Expressing how you foresee cities in an ideal yet probable future, how you dream of achievable utopias, is a poetic exercise that will show the way to your achievable ideals

As part of the effort to recover from the crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, cities can reduce the impact of future pandemics and become more equitable, healthy and environmentally friendly," says a new UN-Habitat report released in late March 2021

The pandemic has indeed revealed what we know without having remembered: viruses like cities because of their narrow and dense configuration. Confinement in the city has made it possible to assess the need **for organizing public space in a "healthy" or even sanitary way.** This need may imply essential arrangements to **protect city dwellers from global warming** by establishing cooling zones, and developing mobility solutions other than the automobile. Local supply is also becoming a concern. It seems that in Europe, a growing number of citizens aspire to live in "medium-sized" cities, or in houses with gardens but close enough to large cities (potentially leading to mobility problems?) Finally, the pandemic and the confinements have highlighted urban precariousness. What is the perspective for ending this crisis?

_With the participation of **Patrick Braouzec**, former deputy mayor of Saint Denis, Honorary President of the National Council of Cities, **Patrick Le Galès**, Director of Research CNRS, Dean of the Urban School of Sciences Po, Professor at Sciences Po, FBA, **Bettina Laville**, Honorary State Councillor, Founding President of the Comité 21. Moderated by **Jean-Eric Auber**t, President of the French Society of Foresight, and of the 2100 Foundation._
