### Setting

[![A blue colored image of an atoll.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Bikini_Atoll.png/220px-Bikini_Atoll.png =220x221)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bikini_Atoll.png)

[Bikini Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini_Atoll "Bikini Atoll"), a coral reef in the Pacific Ocean. [Tom Kenny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kenny "Tom Kenny") confirmed the fictitious city of Bikini Bottom is named after Bikini Atoll.

The series takes place primarily in the fictional [benthic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benthic "Benthic") underwater city of Bikini Bottom located in the [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean") beneath the real-life [coral reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef "Coral reef") known as [Bikini Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini_Atoll "Bikini Atoll").[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-13)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-LADN-14)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-QSR-15)[\[c\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-17) Its citizens are mostly multicolored fish who live in buildings made from ship funnels and use "boatmobiles", amalgamations of cars and boats, as a mode of transportation. Recurring locations within Bikini Bottom include the neighboring houses of [SpongeBob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character) "SpongeBob SquarePants (character)"), [Patrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Star "Patrick Star"), and [Squidward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squidward_Tentacles "Squidward Tentacles"); two competing restaurants, the [Krusty Krab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krusty_Krab "Krusty Krab") and the [Chum Bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton_and_Karen "Plankton and Karen"); Mrs. Puff's Boating School, which includes a driving course and a sunken [lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse "Lighthouse"); the Treedome, an oxygenated glass enclosure where [Sandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Cheeks "Sandy Cheeks") lives; Shady Shoals Rest Home; a [seagrass meadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagrass_meadow "Seagrass meadow") called Jellyfish Fields; and Goo Lagoon, a subaqueous [brine pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine_pool "Brine pool") that is a popular beach hangout.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-18)

When the _SpongeBob_ crew began production of the series' [pilot episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_episode "Pilot episode"), they were tasked with designing stock locations, to be used repeatedly, where most scenes would take place like the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob's pineapple house.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-PittengerHA-19) The idea was "to keep everything nautical", so the crew used plenty of rope, wooden planks, ships' wheels, netting, anchors, boilerplates, and rivets to create the show's setting. Transitions between scenes are marked by bubbles filling the screen, accompanied by the sound of rushing water.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-PittengerHA-19)

The series features "sky flowers" as a main setting material.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-PittengerHA-19) When series background designer Kenny Pittenger was asked what they were, he answered, "They function as clouds in a way, but since the show takes place underwater, they aren't really clouds. Because of the [tiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiki "Tiki") influence on the show, the background painters use a lot of pattern."[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-PittengerHA-19) Pittenger said the sky flowers were meant to "evoke the look of a flower-print Hawaiian shirt".[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-PittengerHA-19)

### Characters

The series' main characters. Top row, from left to right: [Pearl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Krabs "Pearl Krabs"), [Plankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_J._Plankton "Sheldon J. Plankton"), and [Karen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Plankton "Karen Plankton"). Bottom row: [Sandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Cheeks "Sandy Cheeks"), [Mr. Krabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Krabs "Mr. Krabs"), [SpongeBob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character) "SpongeBob SquarePants (character)"), [Squidward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squidward_Tentacles "Squidward Tentacles"), [Gary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_the_Snail "Gary the Snail"), [Patrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Star "Patrick Star"), and [Mrs. Puff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Puff "Mrs. Puff").

The series revolves around the title character and an [ensemble cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast "Ensemble cast") of his aquatic friends. SpongeBob SquarePants is an energetic and optimistic [sea sponge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge "Sponge") who lives in a submerged [pineapple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple "Pineapple") with his pet [snail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_snail "Sea snail") [Gary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SpongeBob_SquarePants_characters#Gary_the_Snail "List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters"), who meows like a cat. SpongeBob has a childlike enthusiasm for life, which carries over to his job as a [fry cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fry_cook "Fry cook") at a [fast food restaurant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food_restaurant "Fast food restaurant") called the Krusty Krab. His greatest goal in life is to obtain a license to drive a boatmobile. His favorite pastimes include "jellyfishing", which involves catching [jellyfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish "Jellyfish") with a net in a manner similar to [butterfly catching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_catching "Butterfly catching"), and blowing soap bubbles into elaborate shapes.

Living two houses away from SpongeBob is his best friend Patrick Star, a dim-witted yet friendly pink [starfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish "Starfish") who resides under a rock. Despite his mental setbacks, Patrick sees himself as intelligent.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-20) Squidward Tentacles, SpongeBob's next-door neighbor and co-worker at the Krusty Krab, is an arrogant, ill-tempered [octopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus "Octopus") who lives in an Easter Island [moai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moai "Moai"). He enjoys playing the [clarinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarinet "Clarinet") and painting self-portraits but hates his job as a [cashier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashier "Cashier"). He also dislikes living between SpongeBob and Patrick because of their childish nature. The owner of the Krusty Krab is a miserly red [crab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab "Crab") named [Mr. Krabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Krabs "Mr. Krabs") who talks like a sailor and runs his restaurant as if it were a [pirate ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_ship "Pirate ship"). He is a single parent with one teenage daughter, a [sperm whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale "Sperm whale") named [Pearl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Krabs "Pearl Krabs"), to whom he wants to bequeath his riches. Pearl does not want to continue the family business and would rather spend her time listening to [pop music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music "Pop music") or working at the local [shopping mall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall "Shopping mall").[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-21) Another of SpongeBob's friends is Sandy Cheeks, a thrill-seeking and athletic [squirrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel "Squirrel") from [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas"), who wears an air-filled [diving suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_suit "Diving suit") to breathe underwater.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-meet-the-gang-22) She lives in an [oak tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_tree "Oak tree") entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal and is an expert in [karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate "Karate"), as well as a [scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist "Scientist").

Located across the street from the Krusty Krab is an unsuccessful rival restaurant called the Chum Bucket.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-23) It is run by a small, green, one-eyed [copepod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copepod "Copepod")[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-24) named [Plankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton_(Spongebob) "Plankton (Spongebob)") and his computer-wife, [Karen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Plankton "Karen Plankton").[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-25) Plankton constantly tries to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, hoping to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-Hist-26) Karen supplies him with evil schemes to obtain the formula, but their efforts are always unsuccessful and their restaurant rarely has any customers.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-nz-27) When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he is often taking boat-driving lessons from [Mrs. Puff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Puff "Mrs. Puff"), a paranoid but patient [pufferfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pufferfish "Pufferfish"). SpongeBob is Mrs. Puff's most diligent student and knows every answer to the oral exams he takes, but he panics and crashes when he tries to drive a real boat.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-28) When Mrs. Puff endures one of SpongeBob's crashes or is otherwise frightened, she puffs up into a ball.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-29)

Special episodes of the show are hosted by a [live-action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action "Live action") pirate named [Patchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patchy_the_Pirate "Patchy the Pirate") and his pet parrot [Potty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potty_the_Parrot "Potty the Parrot"), whose segments are presented in a [dual narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_narrative "Dual narrative") with the animated stories.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-30) Patchy is portrayed as the president of a fictional _SpongeBob_ fan club, and his greatest aspiration is to meet SpongeBob himself. Potty likes to make fun of Patchy's enthusiasm and causes trouble for him while he tries to host the show. An unseen figure called the French Narrator often introduces episodes and narrates the [intertitles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertitle "Intertitle") as if the series were a nature documentary about the ocean. His role and distinctive manner of speaking are references to the oceanographer [Jacques Cousteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau "Jacques Cousteau").[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants#cite_note-Square_Roots-31) Recurring guest characters appear throughout the series including: the retired superheroes [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid_Man_and_Barnacle_Boy "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy"), who are idolized by SpongeBob and Patrick; a pirate [specter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost "Ghost") known as the [Flying Dutchman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Dutchman_SpongeBob "Flying Dutchman SpongeBob"); the muscular lifeguard of Goo Lagoon, [Larry the Lobster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_the_Lobster_(Spongebob) "Larry the Lobster (Spongebob)"); and the [merman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merman "Merman") god of the sea, [King Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SpongeBob_SquarePants_characters#King_Neptune "List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters").
