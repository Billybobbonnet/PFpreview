In addition to the scientific resources available in the "Food for thought" section, the Positive Future team offers scientific events, webinars, and online conferences to help participants in the contest.It's a challenge to say what the city of tomorrow will be like, given the challenges, ruptures and progress of this century, which will lead to radical changes. To say how we dream it in a probable future, how to dream of achievable utopias, is a poetic exercise that takes us into an achievable ideals.

The art and science of futures studies help us obtain a better understanding of the drivers of change by focusing on Long Term, Big Picture and Radical Change: for example, Tech Revolutions (Biohacking plus Artificial Intelligence), Social Upheavals (Massive Access to Free Education/Tools of Production), Business Disruptions (End of Banking), Major Transformations (Post Plastic Society). **Drivers of change are factors causing change, affecting or shaping the futures**.

In this webinar, Victor V. Motti will review some drivers of change such as data, clean energy, automation, green economy, and silver tsunami. He will also report from a global survey of experts on Society and Lifestyles in 2050. The expert sample of the survey was selected from authors of the articles in the leading futures and foresight journals. **This survey shows us how a decentralized and autonomous futurescape is emerging in areas such as consumption of food, manufactured goods, and infrastructure including housing and mobility.**
