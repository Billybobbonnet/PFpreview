2100 seems far away! And it would be impossible to entirely design a sustainable, realistic and liveable city on this horizon within the framework of this competition. 

What we are asking you to do is simpler. We are looking for stories that show that a pleasant and sustainable future is possible, in contrast to the catastrophic anticipations that dominate current representations of the future. 

For this, your story will show, in the background, one or more aspects of a sustainable city in the future. The city is not the focus of your narrative, it is its background, the place where it takes place. Your story, which focuses on its characters and their actions, is an opportunity to show some aspects of this background. We will no doubt see in passing how your characters live, move around, work, etc., and therefore what living, transport, production, leisure, sociability, government, etc. might be like in such a desirable city, while still retaining a certain realism. There is no point in trying to show all the aspects, it is impossible; show some of them well, it is fine. 

The Scientific Council of Positive Future has gathered works that give some ideas on how to realistically think about what the future could be. The idea is to refer to things that are feasible or credible, that we know or think are technically possible, or even that we have already seen working in real-life cases (for example, in terms of forms of governance, work, etc.).

For inspiration, you can consult this knowledge base [http://positive-future.org/resources] to get a general vision of the major issues at stake for a desirable future. You can explore these documents in a targeted way, by keywords, to see how to give substance to the lives and settings of your characters: how they live, earn their living, take care of each other, etc. 

You can, for example, ask yourself the question of the occupation of your characters, their parents, their friends: the occupation you give them may highlight this or that aspect of a desirable future city; getting the characters to move from one place to another is an opportunity to talk about transport; showing them in their daily tasks shows different aspects of the way the city functions, etc.  

The story itself can be anything you want: love, friendship, conflict, discovery, failure, success, dilemma, ambition, mourning. It doesn't matter: humans will always be humans, although the quality of life in the city of the future will positively influence the human experience, promote happiness and ease their sorrows. Make the story interesting for the reader/viewer.

Our jury will pay attention to the story, the quality of the plot and the formal implementation; but also and above all to the realistic, pleasant and lasting nature of the background, the city in which people live. 

By disseminating positive representations of the future, you will contribute to giving everyone a motivation to change the world. Another world is possible if we all put our minds to it. For our part, we will do our best to highlight and spread these optimistic visions. 
Good work!
