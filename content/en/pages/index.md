title: "Positive Future"
subtitle: "Réaliser et promouvoir des visions d'un avenir désirable"

To build a different world together, a common vision is essential, which can only be achieved through concrete projects. While there are many representations of dystopian futures, there is also a large body of research and prospective work drawing positive alternatives for tomorrow's world.

The [Paris Institute for Advanced Study](/who) and the [2100 Fondation](/who)  in partnership with the [Institute for Futures Studies](/who)  are launching the first Positive Future competition in order to encourage, on this positive basis, the elaboration and dissemination of mobilizing imaginaries that convincingly and realistically describe a liveable and desirable world. These are not utopian futures, but possible futures, the advent of which is based on scientifically, technically, socially and politically proven scenarios.

Open to all and international in scope, this competition aims to stimulate alternative and hopeful discourses for the horizon of the century.

**The theme of the first edition of the [competition](/contest)  is "The city in 2100".**
