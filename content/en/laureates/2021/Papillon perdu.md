  Célia Blauel: "Permutter’s story was definitely one of the best stories I had to read. Because for many years now we have been looking for transition stories, but most of the time it’s kind of technocratic, showing us a world. And this story shows us first a character, someone we really want to know, you want to know what is going to happen to this person, to this woman, and to follow her. So for once the character is the main object, but at the same time it gives us all the landscape of transition, talking about climate change and all the implication it has and will have on our lives. So that was interesting because you’re living directly in the world because you believe in the character. Then another thing that I really liked is that it was asking a lot of questions. Because in this future which is the setting the woman is in, one has the positive aspects but also the complex ones, like the AI issue, which you feel is a way to be better in the future, but also puts a lot of interrogations on the way we are going to live. And in the end I loved the idea that, in addition to the climate issue, we have a big focus on biodiversity, which is not so much addressed right now, but it’s a big issue we have to consider. So really character, background of transition, biodiversity and complex questions, these are all the elements that I really liked in that story, and obviously it is taking us into a really positive vision of the future and I really hope that we will live in that future all together."

  Antoine Buéno: "In this story it's the ending that interested me, because something happens at the end, and it's a bit of a surprise for the reader. This is also a quality that one can like to find in a short story."

In _Papillon perdu_, we follow the day of Naomi, a scientist very committed to the harmonious cohabitation of humans and other species. A seemingly ordinary day, from the morning wake-up call to the classic scrolling of the hours of a working day where Naomi meets Jame, a mischievous collaborator who keeps her a big surprise, which will be revealed to the reader at the end of the story. 

Without going as far as pure science fiction, this short story is rich in a myriad of small details of a futuristic daily life where artificial intelligence and new technologies are present at every moment, and where progress and innovations seem to have stopped damaging the environment, making possible a return of lost biodiversity.
