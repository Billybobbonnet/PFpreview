  Amager Bakke, in Copenhagen, Denmark is a unique , waste-to-energy power plant, with a man-made mountain with its own ski slope, the world's tallest climbing wall and challenging hiking trails up the building where you'll find the best views of Copenhagen.
  This building was created to "contribute positively to the city, become part of the city, and even to be a landmark of the capital". The plant serves 680,000 people and takes waste from up to 300 lorries each day. Its steam turbine produces 63MWh of energy, while its heat exchangers are used in a district heating system.
